            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Catherine Smith, and I am an emerging full-stack web developer currently compeleted the University of Richmond's 
                Coding Boot Camp. as well as a recent graduate of the MSc program in Information and Library Studies at the University of Strathclyde 
                in Glasgow. I decided to become a web developer because it's a face-paced, challenging, creative career path with opportunites to grow as a person 
                and professional, and there is more flexibility in this sector than many others.
            </p>
            </p>
                I teach group fitness classes (Les Mills' BodyPump, Core, and BodyFlow, as well as MOSSA's Group Power and Group Blast). 
                I enjoy studying new subjects, drinking tea, spending time with friends and family, watching LOTR, singing, baking, reading books, and 
                listening to audiobooks (particularly if they are narrated by Richard Armitage, Jim Dale, or Stephen Fry)!
