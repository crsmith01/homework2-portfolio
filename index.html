            <p class="about">
                My name is Catherine Smith, and I am an emerging full-stack web developer currently compeleted the University of Richmond's 
                Coding Boot Camp. as well as a recent graduate of the MSc program in Information and Library Studies at the University of Strathclyde 
                in Glasgow. I decided to become a web developer because it's a face-paced, challenging, creative career path with opportunites to grow as a person 
                and professional. While volunteering time as a Library Ambassador at Earl Gregg Swem Library, I worked with the media team to create virtual tours and how-to videos 
                for utilizing library services, and I contacted professors and students to act as a reference point if they had any questions about how to utilize 
                any of the libraries at William and Mary.  Ensuring that people know how to best access and utilize the resources at their disposal is a passion of mine.  I enjoy studying new subjects, learning German and Polish, drinking tea, spending time with friends and family, watching LOTR, singing, baking, reading books, and 
                listening to audiobooks (particularly if they are narrated by Richard Armitage, Elizabeth Wiley, Jim Dale, or Stephen Fry)!
